# Event Management System
This is a terminal-based Event Management System developed for learning object-oriented programming and event-driven logic. It allows staff to create, manage, and close events, while attendees can register, purchase, view, or cancel tickets — all via a simple console interface.

## 📚 Description

This project was developed as part of the **CS2043: Software Engineering** course at the **University of New Brunswick**.

This project simulates a real-world event management process with two types of users:

- **Attendees**: Can register/login, view upcoming events, and manage tickets.
- **Staff**: Can register events, modify schedules/venues, and close events with summary reports.

The project includes key OOP components such as classes for `Event`, `Attendee`, `Ticket`, `Venue`, and `Schedule`.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎫 Buy, view, upgrade, and cancel tickets
- 🏛️ Create and update venue details
- 📅 Manage event schedules and add breaks
- 🔐 Password-protected login for both staff and attendees
- 📊 Generate event summaries on closure
